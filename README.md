Page is available [`https://whoami-ex.fly.dev/`](online) - write me an email on `rafal@skorupa.io` to delete your data. Be aware that I'll be in posession of your Discord's data if you checked it yourself.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup envs based on `.env.example` file (f.e. `cp .env.example .env`, fill in and execute `source .env`) - create Discord Application in Discord developer platform to get variables

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server` or `make server`/`make server.iex` if you've got .env file


Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
